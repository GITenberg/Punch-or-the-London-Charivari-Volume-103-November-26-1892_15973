<h2>LETTERS TO ABSTRACTIONS.</h2>

<h3>No. XVII.&mdash;TO FAILURE.</h3>

<p>A Philosopher has deigned to address to me a letter. "Sir,"
writes my venerable correspondent, "I have been reading your open
letters to Abstractions with some interest. You will, however, perhaps
permit me to observe that amongst those to whom you have
written are not a few who have no right whatever to be numbered
amongst Abstractions. Laziness, for instance, and Crookedness, and
Irritation&mdash;not to mention others&mdash;how is it possible to say that these
are Abstractions? They are concrete qualities and nothing else.
Forgive me for making this correction, and believe me yours, &amp;c. A
<span class="sc">Platonist</span>."&mdash;To which I merely reply, with all possible respect,
"Stuff and nonsense!" I know my letters have reached those to
whom they were addressed, no single one has come back through the
Dead-letter Office, and that is enough for me. Besides, there are
thousands of Abstractions that the mind of "A
<span class="sc">Platonist</span>" has never conceived. Somewhere I
know, there is an abstract Boot, a perfect and
ideal combination of all the qualities that ever
were or will be connected with boots, a grand
exemplar to which all material boots, more or less,
nearly approach; and by their likeness to which
they are recognised as boots by all who in a previous
existence have seen the ideal Boot. Sandals,
mocassins, butcher-boots, jack-boots, these are but
emanations from the great original. Similarly,
there must be an abstract Dog, to the likeness
of which, in one respect or another, both the
Yorkshire Terrier and the St. Bernard conform.
So much then for "<span class="sc">A Platonist</span>." And now to the matter in hand.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:30%;"><a href="images/241.png"><img width="100%" src="images/241.png" alt="" /></a></div>

<p>My dear <span class="sc">Failure</span>, there exists amongst us, as,
indeed, there has always existed, an innumerable
body of those upon whom you have cast your
melancholy blight. Amongst their friends and
acquaintances they are known by the name you
yourself bear. They are the great army of failures.
But there must be no mistake. Because a man
has had high aspirations, has tried with all the
energy of his body and soul to realise them, and
has, in the end, fallen short of his exalted aim,
he is not, therefore, to be called a failure.
<span class="sc">Moses</span>, I may remind you, was suffered only to
look upon the Promised Land from a mountain-top.
Patriots without number&mdash;<span class="sc">Kossuth</span> shall be
my example&mdash;have fought and bled, and have
been thrust into exile, only to see their objects
gained by others in the end. But the final
triumph was theirs surely almost as much as if
they themselves had gained it. On the other
hand there are those who march from disappointment
to disappointment, but remain serenely
unconscious of it all the time. These are not
genuine failures. There is <span class="sc">Charsley</span>, for instance,
journalist, dramatist, novelist&mdash;Heaven knows
what besides. His plays have run, on an average,
about six nights; his books, published mostly at
his own expense, are a drug in the market; but
the little creature is as vain, as proud, and, it
must be added, as contented, as though Fame had set him, with a
blast of her golden trumpet, amongst the mighty Immortals. What
lot can be happier than his? Secure in his impregnable egotism,
ramparted about with mighty walls of conceit, he bids defiance to
attack, and lives an enviable life of self-centred pleasure.</p>

<p>Then, again, there was <span class="sc">Johnnie Truebridge</span>. I do not mean to
liken him to <span class="sc">Charsley</span>, for no more unselfish and kind-hearted
being than <span class="sc">Johnnie</span> ever breathed. But was there ever a stone that
rolled more constantly and gathered less moss? Yet no stroke could
subdue his inconquerable cheerfulness. Time after time he got his
head above the waters; time after time, some malignant emissary of
fate sent him bubbling and gasping down into the depths. He was
up again in a moment, striving, battling, buffeting. Nothing could
make <span class="sc">Johnnie</span> despair, no disappointment could warp the simple
straightforward sincerity, the loyal and almost childlike honesty of
his nature. And if here and there, for a short time, fortune seemed
to shine upon him, you may be sure that there was no single friend
whom he did not call upon to bask with him in these fleeting rays.
And what a glorious laugh he had; not a loud guffaw that splits
your tympanum and crushes merriment flat, but an irrepressible,
helpless, irresistible infectious laugh, in which his whole body became
involved. I have seen a whole roomful of strangers rolling on
their chairs without in the least knowing why, while <span class="sc">Johnnie</span>, with
his head thrown back, his jolly face puckered into a thousand
wrinkles of hearty delight, and his hands pressed to his sides, was
shouting with laughter at some joke made, as most of his jokes were,
at his own expense.</p>

<p>It was during one of his brief intervals of prosperity, at a meet of
the Ditchington Stag-hounds that I first met <span class="sc">Johnnie</span>. He was
beautifully got up. His top-hat shone scarcely less brilliantly than
his rosy cheeks, his collar was of the stiffest, his white tie was folded
and pinned with a beautiful accuracy, his black coat fitted him like
a glove, his leather-breeches were smooth and speckless, and his
champagne-coloured tops fitted his sturdy little legs as if they had
been born with him. He was mounted on an enormous chestnut-horse,
which Anak might have controlled, but which was far above
the power and weight of <span class="sc">Johnnie</span>, plucky and determined though he
was. Shortly after the beginning of the run, while the hounds were
checked, I noticed a strange, hatless, dishevelled figure, riding
furiously round and round a field. It was <span class="sc">Johnnie</span>, whose horse
was bolting with him, but who was just able to guide it sufficiently
to keep it going in a circle instead of taking him far over hill and
dale. We managed to stop him, and I shall never forget
how he laughed at his own disasters while he was
picking up his crop and replacing his hat on his head.
Not long afterwards, I saw our little Mazeppa crashing,
horse and all, into the branches of a tree, but in spite
of a black eye and a deep cut on his cheek, he finished
the run&mdash;fortunately for him a very fast and long one&mdash;with
imperturbable pluck and with no further misadventure. "Nasty cut that," I said to him
as we trained back together, "you'd better
get it properly looked to in town." "Pooh,"
said <span class="sc">Johnnie</span>, "it's a mere scratch. Did
you see the brute take me into the tree?
By Jove, it must have been a comic sight!"
and with that he set off again on another
burst of inextinguishable laughter.</p>

<p>About a week after this, the usual crash
came. A relative of <span class="sc">Johnnie</span> was in difficulties.
<span class="sc">Johnnie</span>, with his wonted chivalry,
came to his help with the few thousands that he
had lately put by, and, in a day or two, he was
on his beam-ends once more. And so the story
went on. Money slipped through his fingers like
water&mdash;prosperity tweaked him by the nose, and
fled from him, whilst friends, not a whit more
deserving, amassed fortunes, and became sleek.
But he was never daunted. With inexhaustible
courage and resource, he set to work again to
rebuild his shattered edifice, confident that luck
would, some day, stay with him for good. But
it never did. At last he threw in his lot with a
band of adventurers, who proposed to plant the
British flag in some hitherto unexplored regions
of South or Central Africa. I dined with
<span class="sc">Johnnie</span> the evening before he left England. He
was in the highest spirits. His talk was of rich
farms, of immense gold-mines. He was off to
make his pile, and would then come home, buy
an estate in the country&mdash;he had one in his eye&mdash;and
live a life of sport, surrounded by all the
comforts, and by all his friends. And so we
parted, never to meet again. He was lost while
making his way back to the coast with a small
party, and no trace of him has ever since been
discovered. But to his friends he has left a memory and an example
of invincible courage, and unceasing cheerfulness in the face of
misfortune, of constant helpfulness, and unflinching staunchness.
Can it be said that such a man was a failure? I don't think so.
I must write again. In the meantime I remain, as usual,</p>

<h2>LADY GAY'S GHOST.</h2>

<p class="author"><i>Mount Street, Berkeley Square.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,</p>

<p>More than a fortnight ago I fled
from the London fog, with the result that it
got thicker than ever about me in the minds
of your readers and yourself! I determined
during my absence to do what many people
in the world of Art and <i>Letters</i> have done
before me, employ a "Ghost"&mdash;(my <i>first</i>
dealings with the supernatural, and probably
my <i>last</i>!). I wired to one of the leading
Sporting Journals for their most reliable
Racing Ghost&mdash;he was busy watching <i>Nunthorpe</i>&mdash;(who
is only the Ghost of what he
was!)&mdash;and the Bogie understudy sent to me
was a Parliamentary Reporter!&mdash;(hence the
stilted style of the letter signed "<span class="sc">Pomperson</span>."
Heavens! what a name!)&mdash;I had five minutes
to explain the situation to him before catching
the <i>train de luxe</i>&mdash;(Lord <span class="sc">Arthur</span> had gone
on with the luggage)&mdash;and I don't think he
had the ghostliest idea of what I wanted!&mdash;the
one point he grasped, was, that he was
to use anonymous names&mdash;which he did with
a vengeance!&mdash;My horror on reading his letter
was such that I dropped all the money I had
in my hand on the "red" instead of the
"black"&mdash;and it won!&mdash;(I think I shall bring out a system based on "fright.")</p>

<p>Of course all my friends thought Lord
<span class="sc">Arthur</span> and I had quarrelled, and I was
"off" with someone else!&mdash;What a fog. This
idea being confirmed by the following week's
letter, which was the well-meant but misdirected
effort of my friend Lady <span class="sc">Harriett
Entoucas</span>, to whom I wired to "do something
for me"&mdash;(she pretty nearly did for me
altogether!)&mdash;there was nothing for it but to
come home&mdash;where I am&mdash;Lord <span class="sc">Arthur</span>
wanted to write you this week, but I thought
one explanation at a time quite enough&mdash;so
his shall follow&mdash;"if you want a thing done,
do it yourself!"&mdash;so in future I will either be
my own Ghost or have nothing to do with them! Yours apparitionally,</p>

of <span class="sc">Androcles</span>, the Roman Slave, as he appeared when, escaping from
his crule owners, he entered a cave and found a lion which persented
'im with 'is bleedin' paw. After some 'esitation, <span class="sc">Androcles</span> examined
the paw, as repperesented before you. (<i>Winds the machinery up,
whereupon the lion opens his lower jaw and emits a mild bleat, while</i>
<span class="sc">Androcles</span> <i>turns his head from side to side in bland surprise.</i>) This
lion is the largest forestbred and blackmaned specimen ever imported
into this country&mdash;the <i>other</i> lion standing beyind (<i>disparagingly</i>), has
nothing whatever to do with the tableau, 'aving been shot recently
in Africa by Mr. <span class="sc">Stanley</span>, the two figgers at the side repperesent the
Boy Murderers who killed their own father at Crewe with a 'atchet
and other 'orrible barbarities. I shall conclude the Collection by
showing you the magnificent group repperesentin' Her Gracious
Majisty the <span class="sc">Queen</span>, as she appeared in 'er 'appier and younger days,
surrounded by the late Mr. <span class="sc">Spurgeon</span>, the 'Eroes of the Soudan, and

<h2>CONVERSATIONAL HINTS FOR YOUNG SHOOTERS.</h2>

<h3 class="sc">The Smoking-Room.</h3>

<p>The subject of the Smoking-room would seem to be intimately and
necessarily connected with the subject of smoke, which was dealt
with in our last Chapter. A very good friend of mine, Captain
<span class="sc">Shabrack</span> of the 55th (Queen <span class="sc">Elizabeth's</span> Own) Hussars, was good
enough to favour me with his views the other day. I met the gallant
officer, who is, as all the world knows, one of the safest and best
shots of the day, in Pall Mall. He had just stepped out of his Club&mdash;the
luxurious and splendid Tatterdemalion, or, as it is familiarly
called, "the Tat"&mdash;where, to use his own graphic language, he had
been "killing the worm with a nip of Scotch."</p>

<p>"Early Scotch woodcock, I suppose," says I, sportively alluding to the proverb.</p>

<p>"Scotch woodcock be blowed," says the Captain, who, it must be confessed,
does not include an appreciation of delicate humour amongst his numerous
merits; "Scotch, real Scotch, a noggin of it, my boy, with soda in a long
glass; glug, glug, down it goes, hissin' over the hot coppers. You know the
trick, my son, it's no use pretendin' you don't"&mdash;and thereupon the high-spirited
warrior dug me good-humouredly in the ribs, and winked at me
with an eye which, if the truth must be told, was bloodshot to the very verge
of ferocity.</p>

<p>"Talkin' of woodcock," he continued&mdash;we were now walking along Pall
Mall together&mdash;"they tell me you're writin' some gas or other about shootin'.
Well, if you want a tip from me, just you let into the smokin' room shots a
bit; you know the sort I mean, fellows who are reg'lar devils at killin'
birds when they haven't got a gun in their hands. Why, there's that little
son of a corn-crake, <span class="sc">Flickers</span>&mdash;when once he gets talkin' in a smokin' room
nothing can hold him. He'd talk the hind leg off a donkey. I know he jolly
nearly laid me out the last time I met him with all his talk&mdash;No, you don't,"
continued the Captain, imagining, perhaps, that I was going to rally him on
his implied connection of himself with the three-legged animal he had
mentioned, "no you don't&mdash;it
wouldn't be funny; and besides, I'm not donkey enough to
stand much of that ass <span class="sc">Flickers</span>. So just you pitch into him, and
the rest of 'em, my bonny boy, next time you put pen to paper." At
this moment my cheerful friend observed a hansom that took his
fancy. "Gad!" he said, "I never can resist one of those india-rubber
tires. Ta, ta, old cock&mdash;keep your pecker up. Never forget
your goloshes when it rains, and always wear flannel next your
skin," and, with that, he sprang into his hansom, ordered the cabman
to drive him round the town as long as a florin would last, and was gone.</p>

<p>Had the Captain only stayed with me a little longer, I should
have thanked him for his hint, which set me thinking. I know
<span class="sc">Flickers</span> well. Many a time have I heard that notorious romancer
holding forth on his achievements in sport, and love, and
society. I have caught him tripping, convicted him of imagination
on a score of occasions; dozens of his acquaintances must
have found him out over and over again; but the fellow sails on,
unconscious of a reverse, with a sort of smiling persistence, down
the stream of modified untruthfulness, of which nobody ought to
know better than <span class="sc">Flickers</span> the rapids, and shallows, and rocks on
which the mariner's bark is apt to go to wreck. What is there in
the pursuit of sport, I ask myself, that brings on this strange tendency
to exaggeration? How few escape it. The excellent, the
prosaic <span class="sc">Dubson</span>, that broad-shouldered, whiskered, and eminently
snub-nosed Nimrod, he too, gives way occasionally. <span class="sc">Flickers's</span>,
I own, is an extreme case. He has indulged himself in fibs to such
an extent, that fibs are now as necessary to him as drams to the
drunkard. But <span class="sc">Dubson</span> the respectable, <span class="sc">Dubson</span> the dull,
<span class="sc">Dubson</span>
the unromantic&mdash;why does the gadfly sting him too, and impel him
now and then to wonderful antics. For was it not <span class="sc">Dubson</span> who told me, only
a week ago, that he had shot three partridges stone dead with one shot, and in
measuring the distance, had found it to be 100 yards less two inches?
Candidly, I do not believe him; but naturally enough I was not going to
be outdone, and I promptly returned on him with my well-known anecdote about
the shot which <i>ricocheted</i> from a driven bird in front of me and pierced my
host's youngest brother&mdash;a plump, short-coated Eton boy, who was for some
reason standing with his back to me ten yards in my rear&mdash;in a part of his
person sacred as a rule <i>plagoso Orbilio</i>. The shrieks of the stricken
youth, I told <span class="sc">Dubson</span>, still sounded horribly in my ears. It took the country
doctor an hour to extract the pellets&mdash;an operation which the boy endured,
with great fortitude, merely observing that he hoped his rowing would
not be spoiled for good, as he should bar awfully having to turn himself
into a dry-bob. This story, with all its harrowing details, did I duly
hammer into the open-mouthed <span class="sc">Dubson</span>, who merely remarked that "it
was a rum go, but you can never tell where a <i>ricochet</i>
will go," and was beginning upon me with a brand-new <i>ricochet</i> anecdote of
his own, when I hurriedly departed.</p>

<p>Wherefore, my gay young shooters, you who week by week suck wisdom and conversational
ability from these columns,
it is borne in upon me that for your benefit I must treat of the
Smoking-room in its connection with shooting-parties. Thus, perhaps,
you may learn not so much what you ought to say, as what
you ought not to say, and your discretion shall be the admiration of
a whole country-side. "The Smoking-room: with which is incorporated
'Anecdotes.'" What a rollicking, cheerful, after-dinner
sound there is about it. <span class="sc">Shabrack</span> might say it was like the title
of a cheap weekly, which as a matter of fact, it does resemble. But
what of that? Next week we will begin upon it in good earnest.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>Books from the publishing house of <span class="sc">Fisher Unwin</span> are always
goodly to look upon, the public having to thank him for something
new in form, binding, and colour, in other series than the Pseudonym
Library. In a new edition of <i>The Sinner's Comedy</i>, just issued at
the modest price of Eighteenpence, he has solved a problem that has
long baffled the publisher, and bothered the public. Few like the
appearance of a book with the pages machine-cut; fewer still can
spare the time to cut a book. Mr. <span class="sc">Fisher Unwin</span> compromises by
presenting this dainty little volume with the top pages ready cut,
the reader having nothing to do but to slice the side-pages, a labour
which no book-lover would grudge, seeing that it leaves the volume
with the uncut appearance dear to his heart. The story, told
in 146 pages, is, my Baronite says, worthy the distinction of its
appearance. The characters are clearly drawn, the plot is interesting,
the conversation crisp, and the style throughout pleasantly
cynical. The author, <span class="sc">John Oliver Hobbes</span>, has a pretty turn of
aphorism. "A man's way of loving is so different from a woman's";
and again, "Genius is so rare, and ambition is so common." Here
be truths, old enough perhaps, but cleverly re-set.</p>

<p>Some people complain that politics are dull. They should read
the parliamentary and extra-parliamentary utterances of the Member
for Wrottenborough. They appear weekly in that rising young
paper, the <i>Sunday Times</i>, and an extremely readable selection of
them has lately been published "in book form," for the enlivening
of the Recess. Adapting the Laureate's lines, the Baron would say,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"They who would vote for an M.P. whose sense with humour chimes,</p>
<p>Will read the Member for Wrottenborough, all in the <i>Sunday Times</i>&mdash;</p>
<p>A paper our sires paid Sevenpence for, along of its grit and go,</p>
<p class="i4">Seventy years ago, my Public, seventy years ago!"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>For whimsical audacity, and quaint unexpectedness. Mr. <span class="sc">Pain</span>, in
his latest book, <i>Playthings and Parodies</i>, would be hard to beat.
In this there is a good back-ground of shrewd observation. He does
not propose to make your flesh creep, or your eyes run torrents. He
simply succeeds in making you laugh. In "The Processional
Instinct," Mr. <span class="sc">Pain</span> informs us that he has discovered that our private
life is circular, and our public life is rectilineal. <span class="sc">Shakspeare</span>, who,
being for all time, and not merely for an age, recommends this
author to the general public when he says that everybody "should
be so conversant with <span class="sc">Pain</span>."</p>

<p><i>The Memories of Dean Hole</i> is rather a misleading title; "but,"
says the Baron, "I suppose the term 'Reminiscences' is played out.
The word 'Memories' seems to suggest that someone, whether
Dean <span class="sc">Hole</span>, or Dean <span class="sc">Corner</span>, or any other Dean, had more than one
memory, as indeed those persons appear to possess who mention their
'good memory for names,' and their 'bad memory for dates,' and <i>vice
versâ</i>. <i>Soit!</i>" quoth the Baron, in excellent French, "you may take
it from me (if I'll part with it) that the Hole book is by no means a
half-and-half sort of book, but is vastly entertaining." The stories
of "The Cloth" form the most entertaining part of the work. The
Baron wishes success to this work of the Dean in Holey Orders, and
suggests that the volume should be re-entitled <i>Gathered Leaves from
Dean Hole's Rose Garden</i>, a better title than "Reminiscences."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marion Crawford's</span> <i>Don Orsino</i> (published by <span class="sc">Macmillan &amp;
Co.</span>) would be worth reading were it only for the colour of its word-painting,
and for its high-comedy dialogue. Yet is Mr. <span class="sc">Crawford</span>
rather given to pause in his story, for the sake of moralising
on the tendencies of the age; and the reader, patient though he
may be, when he has become interested in the personages of the
novel, does not care to be button-holed by a digression. <span class="sc">Marion
Crawford's</span> recipe for commencing an amorous duologue (early in
Vol. III.), which is to lead up to a declaration of love, is deliciously
ingenious. It begins with the gentleman taking a seat, and his first
remark is upon the chair. Mr. <span class="sc">Crawford</span> evidently remembers the
old story of how the tenor who knew but one song, "<i>In my Cottage
near a Wood</i>," used to introduce it into any scene of any Opera by
the simple process of making his entrance alone and finding a chair on
the stage. "Aha!" quoth he. "What's this? A chair? and made
of wood! Ah! that word! how it reminds me of my 'umble home,
'my cottage near a wood.'" Cue for band; chord; song. In this
instance, the love-scene, admirably led up to on the above plan, is
strikingly powerful; it is the work of a master-hand. The <i>dénoûment</i>
is both artistically original and, at the same time, ordinarily
probable. May all readers enjoy this excellent novel as much as has the sympathetic</p>

<h2>LOCAL COLOUR.</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Alfred Austin</span>, in his new poem,
<i>Fortunatus, the Pessimist</i>, has hit upon a
new notion, to say nothing of a novel rhyme. Sings he:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"When the foal and brood-mare hinny,</p>
<p>And in every cut-down spinney</p>
<p>Lady's-Smocks grow <i>mauve and mauver</i>,</p>
<p>Then the Winter days are over."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>This opens a polychromatic vista to the
New Poetry. Technical Art comes to the
aid of the elder Muses. The products of gas-tar
alone should greatly regenerate a something time-worn poetic phraseology. As thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>When the poet, Mr. <span class="sc">Pennyline</span>,</p>
<p>Is inspired by beauteous Aniline,</p>
<p>Products chemical and gas-tarry</p>
<p>Give the modern Muse new mastery.</p>
<p>Mauve <i>may</i> chime with love, and mauver</p>
<p>Form a decent rhyme to lover;</p>
<p>While (and if not, why not?) <i>mauvest</i></p>
<p>Antiphonetic proves to lovest.</p>
<p>(Verse erotic always sports</p>
<p>Tricksily with longs and shorts.</p>
<p>Verbal votaries of Venus</p>
<p>Are an arbitrary genus,</p>
<p>And as arrogant as <span class="sc">Howells</span></p>
<p>In their dealings with the vowels.</p>
<p><i>Love, move, rove</i>, linked in a sonnet,</p>
<p>Pass for rhymes; the best have done it!)</p>
<p>Then again there is Magenta!</p>
<p>Surely science never sent a</p>
<p>Handier rhyme to&mdash;well, polenta,</p>
<p>Or (for Cockney Muses) Mentor!</p>
<p>The poetic sense auricular</p>
<p>Can't afford to be particular.</p>
<p>Rags of rhymes, mere assonances,</p>
<p>Now must serve. Pegasus prances,</p>
<p>Like a Buffalo Bill buck-jumper,</p>
<p>When you have a "regular stumper"</p>
<p>(Such as "silver") do not care about</p>
<p>Perfect rhyming; "there or thereabout"</p>
<p>Is the Muse's maxim now.</p>
<p>You <i>may</i> get (bards have, I trow)</p>
<p>Rhyme's last minimum irreducible,</p>
<p>From dye-vat, retort, or crucible.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Verily (as <i>Touchstone</i> says), "I'll rhyme
you so, eight years together, dinners and
suppers, and sleeping hours excepted." And
if it is "the right butterwoman's rate to
market," or "the very false gallop of verses,"
it is at any rate good enough for a long-eared
public or a postulant for the Laureateship.</p>

<h2>WAR ON A LARGE SCALE.</h2>

<h4>(<i>An Account of the Conflict, from the Diary of an Inhabitant of Herne Bay.</i>)</h4>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Extremely awkward&mdash;the entire
British Fleet have come ashore; and, as it
is impossible to move them on account of
their enormous tonnage, this will entail a loss of £24,000,000,000!</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Troubles never come singly!
The French, taking advantage of the temporary
suspension of our naval operations,
have declared war. This means the utter
ruin of the bathing season, not only at Herne
Bay, but Southend, and the Isle of Thanet.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;As I expected! The French
Fleet are coming up towards London. They
are sure to pepper us as they pass. As every
gun carries several hundred miles, I do not
see how books can be uninterruptedly issued
from and returned to the Circulating Library.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Our first slice of luck! The
entire French Fleet during the mist last night
came into collision with the Nore Light, and
sank immediately. I was surprised at their
sparing the Reculvers and the local bathing-machines,
but now the mystery is explained.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Just learned that the great gun
of Paris, which carries forty-four thousand
miles, is to be tried for the first time to-morrow.
It would have been used earlier, had it
not been necessary to raise a foreign loan to
supply funds to load it. Trust it won't be
laid in our direction. This war has already
caused the Insurance Companies to double their charges! Too bad!</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;All's well that ends well.
Hostilities are at an end. This morning all
the glass in the windows were broken at
8 o'clock. Ten minutes later the Champs
Elysées was deposited half a mile from Birchington. We now know that the great Paris
gun burst on its first discharge, and France
exists no longer as a country, but as a "geographical
expression" is deposited in various parts of Europe.</p>

<hr />

<p>REAL AND IDEAL.&mdash;"A Really Hard-Headed Man"&mdash;the Iron-skulled individual
now exhibiting at the Aquarium. If his will
is as iron as his head, what a despot he would
be! If France is tired of her Republic, she
might try the Iron-Headed Man as a ruler.
There is the chance, of course, that he might
turn out a numskull, and be only King Log, after all.</p>

<h3>THE LAST DISCOVERY.</h3>

<h4>(<i>A Sequel to a recent Lecture. By Mr. Punch's Prophetic Reporter.</i>)</h4>

<p>The enormous crowd cheered again and
again. It was furious. The enthusiasm spread
from throng to throng, until a mighty chorus
filled every portion of the land. And there was
indeed reason for the rejoicing. Had not the
great Arctic Explorer come home? Had he not
been to the North Pole and back? At that very
moment were not a couple of steam-tugs drawing
his wooden vessel towards his native
shore? It was indeed a moment for congratulation&mdash;not only personal but national, nay
cosmopolitan. The victory of art over nature
belonged to more than a country, it belonged to the world!</p>

<p>And the tugs came closer and closer, and the
cheers grew louder and louder. Then the
vessel bearing the Explorer was near at hand.
The crowd joyously jumped into the water,
and raising him on their shoulders, bore him triumphantly to land.</p>

<p>How they welcomed him! How they seized
his hands and kissed them! How they cried
and called him "Master," and "Victor," and
"Hero!" It was a scene never to be forgotten!</p>

<p>When the excitement had somewhat subsided,
they began to ask him questions. At
last one of them wished to know how he contrived
to find the North Pole and get back in safety?</p>

<p>"You intended to drift?" said they.
"Great and glorious hero, victorious victor,
triumphant explorer, did you do this?"</p>

<p>"I did," was the reply.</p>

<p>"And tell us what was your method of
obtaining the knowledge you now possess?
Oh, great chief, how <i>did</i> you manage it?"</p>

<p>Then came the answer&mdash;</p>

<p>"By sitting still, and doing nothing!"</p>

<p>And now it being dark, they separated to
illuminate their homes in honour of the fresh
industry&mdash;an industry admirably adapted to
that great and contented class of the community, the Unemployed!</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
